# Shopping App

This app enables multiple users to manage a shopping list and marks, which user added which product at a specific point of time. Therefore, each user can register himself using an email address and a password.

This app uses Dart and Flutter to run an app on iOS and Android. 
The backend works with Firebase. The products of the shopping list are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database. To fetch and update the products, the app communicates with Firebase through a REST API. The authentication is managed by Firebase Authentication.
